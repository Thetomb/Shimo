                        <p>In 2005, our founder, Mr. Liu, spent 12-hour workdays hunched over a rigid office desk. After developing chronic back pain, he realized: "Why should work hurt?" This sparked the birth of Ningbo Shimo International Trade—a mission to redefine office wellness through ergonomic innovation.</p>

During that time, it was impossible to find an ergonomic monitor mount for under $100. Our founder felt strongly that quality ergonomic solutions should be affordable and available to everyday users.</p>
